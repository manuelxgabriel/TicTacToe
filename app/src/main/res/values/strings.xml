        <b>Tic Tac Toe Rules:</b>
        <br /><br />
        1. <b>Objective:</b> The objective of Tic Tac Toe is to be the first player to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
        <br /><br />
        2. <b>Players:</b> The game is played between two players. One player uses X and the other uses O.
        <br /><br />
        3. <b>Game Board:</b> The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Each cell in the grid can be empty, contain an X, or contain an O.
        <br /><br />
        4. <b>Turn Order:</b> Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) on an empty cell of the grid.
        <br /><br />
        5. <b>Winning:</b> The first player to place three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
        <br /><br />
        6. <b>Draw:</b> If all cells are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
        <br /><br />
